I am a PhD candidate in econometrics at the [University of St.Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/), Switzerland,
under the supervision of Prof. Dr. [Michael Lechner](https://www.michael-lechner.eu/). I am also affiliated
with the Swiss Institute for Empirical Economic Research ([SEW](https://sew.unisg.ch/en/)). My research
interests lie at the intersection of econometrics and machine learning, focusing on both predictive as well
as causal machine learning. I am particularly interested in estimators based on random forests. Besides the
theory I also enjoy the statistical programming of the related algorithms, mainly using [R](https://cran.r-project.org/).
In my spare time I like to go hiking and do photography.
