I am a postdoctoral researcher in data science at the Chair for Technology and Innovation Strategy ([TIS-EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/tis/)).
I completed my doctoral studies in econometrics at the [University of St.Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/), Switzerland,
under the supervision of Prof. Dr. [Michael Lechner](https://www.michael-lechner.eu/). Prior to joining EPFL I was affiliated
with the Swiss Institute for Empirical Economic Research ([SEW-HSG](https://sew.unisg.ch/en/)). My research
interests lie at the intersection of econometrics and machine learning, focusing on both predictive as well
as causal machine learning. I am particularly interested in robust machine learning and estimators based on random forests.
Besides the theory I also enjoy the statistical programming of the related algorithms, mainly using [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
and [Python](https://www.python.org/). In my spare time I like to go hiking and do photography.
