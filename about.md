I am a PhD candidate in econometrics at the University of St.Gallen, Switzerland,
under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Michael Lechner. I am also affiliated with the
Swiss Institute for Empirical Economic Research (SEW-HSG). My research interests lie at
the intersection of econometrics and machine learning, focusing on both predictive
as well as causal machine learning. I am particularly interested in estimators
based on random forests. Besides the theory I also enjoy the statistical programming
of the related algorithms, mainly using R. In my spare time I like to go hiking and 
do photography.
